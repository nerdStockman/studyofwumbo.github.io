      <p>Hi, I’m Tom — a researcher, tinkerer, and lifelong learner. I set up this page to aggregate some of my projects to make them easier to share and to link some interactive pages for demonstration purposes.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My current professional research is mostly focused on nuclear measurement, but I've done all sorts of things in the past. Rocket testing and manufacturing, heat transfer modeling in grad school, materials science, statistics, hobby publications in medical engineering and astronomy. I love learning, studying, modeling, and doing.
    </p>
	<p>
	  I also love education. I get to teach nuclear material assay to international audiences for my job, and I also guest lecture at universities, volunteer at a summer STEM camp, and generally just work with students any chance I get.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In my whole career to date, the biggest lesson I've learned and continue to learn is how easily I'm fooled. My favorite talk to give students is a history of all the failures and setbacks I've endured that somehow still led to where I am now. I love criticism of my work, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.
